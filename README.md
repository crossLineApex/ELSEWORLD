# ELSEWORLD

This is when I started learning Python and looking new applications using Python apart from Machine Learning and I came across with Tkinter.

Tkinter is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. As a beginner in Python this looked very awesome and I started working on a
complex Calculator and converting it into a Desktop application and gladly it worked.

I wpuld suggest programmers to look for more applications for any particular language they prefer and venture into various possibilities
